## üåü About The Project

This project was born out of a desire to see how quickly a complex, real-world application could be developed using modern AI tools. The entire initial structure and core logic were scaffolded in a remarkably short amount of time, proving that AI is a transformative force in software development.

The result is not just a demo, but a robust, real-time service that includes:
* **Secure User Authentication:** Safe and secure login to manage user sessions.
* **AI-Powered Estimates:** Leverages an AI model to provide intelligent insights before connecting.
* **Real-time Chat Support:** An integrated chat system for instant user support.
